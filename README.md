# 100DaysofMLCode





So, I've been learning about Machine learning and Data Science
since a few months now but it's mostly scattered in bits and patches
across my handwritten notes, google keep, and jupyter notebook.

Hence, I've decided to upload my daily learnings in the related domains
here at this repo! 
Each day will have a seperate folder (self explanatory)

Follow me on twitter for I'll be daily uploading a summary of the there 
as well.
